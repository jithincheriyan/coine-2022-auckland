# Objectives

Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms and ethics are five key governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, norm-aware and ethical agents.

The pervasiveness of "open systems" raises a range of challenges and opportunities for technologies in the area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. However, achieving and maintaining a "good" society is difficult to achieve as the participating entities (including human users), their modes of interaction or the intended purpose of the system may change over time. Moreover, in the case of open multi-agent systems, the autonomy of the agents can work against the effectiveness of the society. As a further trajectory of influence, coordination techniques such as distributed ledger technology can increase the autonomy and complexity of these open systems as a whole and challenge their governance. There is therefore a need for tools and techniques for articulating interactions in order to make the system more effective in attaining collective goals, more certain for participants or more predictable.

This workshop is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at various conferences including AAMAS (12 times), IJCAI (twice), AAAI and ECAI since 2006 (see [COIN Series Website](http://www2.pcs.usp.br/~coin)), and produced 13 volumes of post-proceedings in Springer's Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (see [COIN Proceedings](https://www2.pcs.usp.br/~coin/coin_springer.html)). The 14th volume of COINE post-proceedings is in progress.  In 2020, ethics was added to the name and acronym (now COINE), and also the notion of governance of MAS was added to the full workshop title as this is the common objective uniting the various threads of research (coordination, organizations, etc.) undertaken. The workshop in the new format has been held twice (2020 and 2021). COINE has achieved a ranking of B on the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE) conference ranking list [http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/2160/](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/2160/). 

This edition of COINE will be hosted by [AAMAS 2023](https://aamas2023.soton.ac.uk/) and will complement the main conference program by allowing a more relaxed and in-depth discussion of MAS from a social perspective. Under its new COINE brand, this workshop will not only be of interest to its traditional sub-community of AAMAS participants (those researchers working on coordination, organisational, institutional and normative models and technologies for MAS), but also invites researchers investigating the growing field of ethical governance of MAS.
