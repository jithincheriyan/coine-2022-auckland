### Consent as a Foundation for Responsible Autonomy

**Abstract:** This talk focuses on a dynamic aspect of responsible autonomy, namely, to make intelligent agents act responsibly at run time.  That is, it considers settings where decision making by agents impinges upon the outcomes perceived by other agents.  For an agent to act responsibly, it must accommodate the desires and other attitudes of its users and, through other agents, of their users.

The contribution of this talk is twofold.  First, it provides a conceptual analysis of consent, its benefits and misuses, and how understanding consent can help achieve responsible autonomy.  Second, it outlines challenges for AI (in particular, for agents and multiagent systems) that merit investigation to form a basis for modeling consent in multiagent systems and applying consent to achieve responsible autonomy.

**Bio:** Dr. Munindar P. Singh is an Alumni Distinguished Graduate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University.  Munindar's research interests include artificial intelligence and multiagent systems with applications in service-oriented computing, cybersecurity, privacy, and social computing.  He is a codirector of the DoD-sponsored Science of Security Lablet at NCSU, one of six nationwide.

Munindar was the editor-in-chief of the ACM Transactions on Internet Technology from 2012 to 2018 and the editor-in-chief of IEEE Internet Computing from 1999 to 2002.  His current editorial service includes IEEE Internet Computing, Journal of Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, IEEE Transactions on Services Computing, and ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology.  His previous editorial service includes the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research and the Journal of Web Semantics.  Munindar served on the founding board of directors of IFAAMAS, the International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems.  He also served on the founding steering committee for the IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.  Munindar was a general cochair for the 2005 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems and a general cochair for the 2016 International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing.

Munindar is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and a member of Academia Europaea.  He has won the ACM/SIGAI Autonomous Agents Research Award, the IEEE TCSVC Research Innovation Award, and the IFAAMAS Influential Paper Award.  He won NC State University's Outstanding Research Achievement Award twice, was selected as an Alumni Distinguished Graduate Professor, and is a member of NCSU's Research Leadership Academy.  He won NCSU's Faculty Graduate Mentor Award.

Munindar's research has been recognized with awards and sponsorship by (alphabetically) Army Research Lab, Army Research Office, Cisco Systems, Consortium for Ocean Leadership, DARPA, Department of Defense, Ericsson, Facebook, IBM, Intel, National Science Foundation, and Xerox.  Twenty-nine students have received PhD degrees and thirty-nine students MS degrees under Munindar's direction.
